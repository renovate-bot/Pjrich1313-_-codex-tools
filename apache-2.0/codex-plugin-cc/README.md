# Codex plugin for Claude Code

Use Codex from inside Claude Code for code reviews or to delegate tasks to Codex.

This plugin is for Claude Code users who want an easy way to start using Codex from the workflow
they already have.

## What You Get

- `/codex:review` for a normal read-only Codex review
- `/codex:adversarial-review` for a steerable challenge review
- `/codex:rescue`, `/codex:transfer`, `/codex:status`, `/codex:result`, and `/codex:cancel` to delegate work, hand off sessions, and manage background jobs

## Requirements

- **ChatGPT subscription (incl. Free) or OpenAI API key.**
  - Usage will contribute to your Codex usage limits.
- **Node.js 18.18 or later**

## Install

Add the marketplace in Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add openai/codex-plugin-cc
```

Install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install codex@openai-codex
```

Reload plugins:

```bash
/reload-plugins
```

Then run:

```bash
/codex:setup
```

`/codex:setup` will tell you whether Codex is ready. If Codex is missing and npm is available, it can offer to install Codex for you.

If you prefer to install Codex yourself, use:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

If Codex is installed but not logged in yet, run:

```bash
!codex login
```
